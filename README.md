# Sportradar_Task
This program gives the most important information about as many as you want most probable results with additional information about team names, match date and venue. 
It also gives the list of all the uniques team names in alphabetic order.
The whole interface of the program is made in terminal.
It takes the date form a .json file and converts for very useful classes. Obviously you can add your date to the list but remember to keep the same structure of the data as it is currently.

How to run the program?
You have two possible ways to run the program.

A) Usage of terminal:
1. Open terminal.
2. Find the location of Sport Program folder.
3. Go inside Sport Program folder.
4. Use command: java -jar Sportradar_Repository.jar

B) Usage of IDE:
(I highly recommend IntelliJ IDEA, but those simple steps should look nearly the same or familiar in other IDE.)
1) Build the whole project.
2) Go to the Main class.
3) Run "Main.java" (This class has only one method/function that is main().

Enjoy the usage of the program!
